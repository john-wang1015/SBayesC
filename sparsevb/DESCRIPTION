Description: Implements variational Bayesian algorithms to perform scalable variable selection for sparse, high-dimensional linear and logistic regression. Features include a novel prioritized updating scheme, which computes a preliminary estimator for the variational means during initialization and generates an update order prioritizing large coefficients. Sparsity is induced via spike-and-slab priors with either Laplace or Gaussian slabs. By default, the heavier-tailed Laplace density is used.
